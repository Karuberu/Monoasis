This is a collection of CSS changes designed to make Wikia's Oasis skin look and feel more similar to the [Monobook skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:MonoBook), which is no longer available on Wikia sites.

The CSS can be applied using [Personal CSS](https://community.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Personal_CSS_and_JS) or through the browser with plugins like [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/).
